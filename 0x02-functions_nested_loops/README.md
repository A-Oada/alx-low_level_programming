# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
This project touches on the following topics:
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
* What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`
## The mandatory tasks completed in this project are:
0. \_putchar
	* File: `0-putchar.c`
	* A program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.
1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
	* File: `1-alphabet.c`
	* A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
2. 10 x alphabet
	* File: `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`
	* A function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. islower
	* File: `3-islower.c`
	* A function that checks for lowercase character.
	* Returns `1` if `c` is lowercase
	* Returns `0` otherwise
4. isalpha
	* File: `4-isalpha.c`
	* A function that checks for alphabetic character.
	* Returns `1` if `c` is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
	* Returns `0` otherwise
5. Sign
	* File: `5-sign.c`
	* A function that prints the sign of a number.
	* Returns `1` and prints `+` if `n` is greater than zero
	* Returns `0` and prints `0` if `n` is zero
	* Returns `-1` and prints `-` if `n` is less than zero
6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
	* File: `6-abs.c`
	* A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
	* File: `7-print_last_digit.c`
	* A function that prints the last digit of a number.
8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
	* File: `8-24_hours.c`
	* A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
9. Learn your times table
	* File: `9-times_table.c`
	* A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
10. a + b
	* File: `10-add.c`
	* A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. 98 Battery Street, the OG
	* File: `11-print_to_98.c`
	* A function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.
	* Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
	* Numbers are printed in order
	* The first printed number is the number passed to the function
	* The last printed number is be `98`
